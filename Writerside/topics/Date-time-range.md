# Date time range

This feature offers a sophisticated input with dropdown calendars for selecting both a start and end date and time, defining an interval.
```php
$form->date_time_range('subscribed_range', 'User subscribed')
```
Supports the icon methods of the `FontAwesome` library. Available list of links to icons can be seen in [file at link](https://github.com/bfg-s/admin/blob/master/src/Traits/FontAwesome.php).
