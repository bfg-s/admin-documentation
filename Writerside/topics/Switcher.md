# Switcher

A complex switch between 1 and 0 provides users with a versatile input mechanism to toggle between two states, typically represented by the values 1 and 0. This type of switch may offer additional features and functionality compared to a standard binary switch.
```php
$form->switcher('active', 'Post active')
```
