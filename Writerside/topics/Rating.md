# Rating

A complex input in the form of rating stars allows users to rate an item by selecting a specific number of stars. This input method typically displays a set of stars, and users can click on a star to indicate their rating. It's commonly used for rating products, services, or other items where a qualitative assessment is required. The number of stars selected represents the user's rating, with more stars indicating a higher rating.
```php
$form->rating('stars', 'Commentary stars')
```
