# Time

A complex field with a drop-down interface for selecting the time provides users with a user-friendly and intuitive way to input time values.
```php
$form->time('run_every', 'User schedule')
```
Supports the icon methods of the `FontAwesome` library. Available list of links to icons can be seen in [file at link](https://github.com/bfg-s/admin/blob/master/src/Traits/FontAwesome.php).
